# 🎓 Student Performance Analysis

This project explores student performance trends across **Math**, **Reading**, and **Writing** by analyzing how demographic and parental factors influence academic outcomes using Microsoft Excel.

---

## 🎯 Objective of the Project

To identify trends, patterns, and disparities in academic performance among students using demographic and educational background data.

---

## ❓ Problem Being Addressed

In education, understanding what drives academic excellence is crucial. Factors such as parental education, test preparation, and ethnicity may affect student performance. Identifying these patterns helps schools implement better support systems and improve academic success.

## 📂 Dataset & Methodologies

- **Dataset**: 1,000 students  
- **Tools Used**: Microsoft Excel  
- **Techniques**: Pivot Tables, SUM function, data cleaning, and analysis

**Data Attributes:**

- **Independent Variables**:  
  `Full Name, Gender, Race/Ethnicity, Parental Education, Lunch, Test Preparation Course`

- **Dependent Variables**:  
  `Math Score, Reading Score, Writing Score, Average Score, Performance Level`

## 📊 Story of Data

### 🔗 Data Source  
Student academic performance dataset compiled from school assessments.

### 📥 Collection Process  
Likely sourced from internal academic records or standardized test databases.

### 🧱 Data Structure  
Each row represents an individual student with both independent and dependent variables.

### ⭐ Key Features & Significance

- **Scores (Math, Reading, Writing)**: Core indicators of academic performance  
- **Average Score**: Summary of student academic strength  
- **Performance Level**: Categorized as High (≥70), Medium (50–69), Low (<50)  
- **Parental Education**: Influences home academic environment  
- **Test Preparation**: Impacts readiness and outcomes

### ⚠️ Limitations or Biases  
Uneven parental education representation (e.g., few students with Master’s Degrees)

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing & Split

### ✅ Data Cleaning
- Standardized inconsistent entries
- Removed duplicates/missing values

### 🧪 Transformations
- Created performance bands: High (≥70), Medium (50–69), Low (<50)

### 🔀 Variable Split

| Independent                     | Dependent                          |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Full Name                      | Math Score                         |
| Gender                         | Reading Score                      |
| Race/Ethnicity                 | Writing Score                      |
| Parental Level of Education    | Average Score                      |
| Lunch                          | Performance Level                  |
| Test Preparation Course        |                                    |

## 📌 Pre-Analysis Insights

### Key Questions:
- What are the subject-wise averages?
- How are students distributed across performance categories?
- Which gender excels in specific subjects?
- How does parental education influence scores?

### Key Stats:
- Most students have parents with *Some College (226)* or *Associate’s Degree (222)*
- Fewest students have parents with a *Master’s Degree (59)*
- Gender split: *Female (518)* vs *Male (482)*
- Performance distribution: *High (633)*, *Medium (219)*, *Low (148)*

## 📍 In-Analysis Observations

- 🏅 **Top Performers**: Wilson Wright, Zain Voss, Best Lowery – perfect scores (Avg: 233)
- 📉 **Lowest Performers**: Cleo Pike (Math: 0), Dunn Glover, Remy Nash, Patton Faith, Nina Beck
- 📊 **Highest Avg Scores by Parental Education**:  
  *Some College (36,045)* > *Associate’s Degree (35,991)*
- 📉 **Lowest Avg**: *Master’s Degree (10,048)* – likely due to small sample
- 🎨 **Race Groups**: Group C (319 high performers), Group A (89 - lowest)
- 👥 **Gender Gaps**: Male students stronger in Math; females excel in Reading/Writing

---

## ✅ Final Recommendations

### 1. Gender-Specific Support
- Strengthen reading/writing support for male students
- Promote math confidence programs for female students

### 2. Educational Equity
- Provide additional support to students from families with low parental education

### 3. Boost Prep Program Enrollment
- Make test prep courses accessible/compulsory for low performers

### 4. Address Gaps in Access
- Offer free tutoring and mentorship for students on free/reduced lunch

### 5. Early Identification & Intervention
- Track students by demographics/performance for early academic support

### 6. Supplemental Learning
- Create holiday bootcamps
- Pair strong math students with weak readers for peer learning
